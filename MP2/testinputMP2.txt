This is a test script to show a few simple tests for the linked list ADT.
It provides an example of a test plan, but it does not consider many cases.

You must create your own test script that tests for other cases.  You can start
with this file and edit it to build your own test plan.  

Assumptions: these tests are designed with a list size of 4.  

TEST 1:  Add three entries to list.

To determine if test 1 passes look for three "Inserted" messages

TEST 2: Print the list and verify three entries are sorted 

PRINT
STATS

To deterine if test 2 passes the list should be printed in order with 3 records.
Also, stats should show 3 records in the contact list and none in the exposure list

TEST 3:  Update the 111 entry in the list and add an ID to fill the table

To determine if test 3 passes look for "Updated" and "Inserted" messages

TEST 4: Print the list, verify the entry for id 111 is replaced

PRINT
STATS

To determine if test 4 passes look for 4 records, and the 111 record should be 
updated with Rec# as 4.  Stats should be 4 contact records, and none in the exposure list

TEST 5: look for records in the list and not in the list

QUERY 111
QUERY 551 
QUERY 3
QUERY 555

To determine if test 5 passes it should print two records found and
two records not found.  

TEST 6:  Attempt to add fifth record. If list size is 4 then it will replace 551 

ADDID 222

To check test 6, look for Removed if list size is four.  Record 222 was
added and record 551 was removed. Print shows 4 records Stats shows 4 records.  
If the program is run with a list
size of 5 or larger then the record should be added instead of replaced.

TEST 7: Remove the oldest record number in the list 

TRIM
PRINT
STATS
PRINTEXP

To verify test 7, should see removed 100, and final list
should be printed with 3 records.

TEST 8: Match one record in list.  Verify 222 is moved to exposure list

MATCH 2

QUERY 222
PRINT
PRINTEXP
STATS

To verify this test, confirm that there was 1 match and record 222 was moved.

TEST 9:  First try to clear when there are no old records.  Then clear all from contact list

CLEAROLD 106
PRINT
STATS
CLEAROLD 107
PRINT
STATS
PRINTEXP

To verfity check the first clear did not change the list but the second removed all entries
from the contact list.  The exposure list still has 222.  

TEST 10: Test exposure list.  Add 4 items to contact list.  Match all four items to move
         to exposure list.  Print the newest and then clear the list.
