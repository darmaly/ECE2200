This is a test script to show a few simple tests for the sequential list ADT.
It provides an example of a test plan, but it does not consider many cases.

You must create your own test script that tests for other cases.  You can start
with this file and edit it to build your own test plan.  

Assumptions: these tests are designed with a list size of 4.  

TEST 1:  Add three entries to list.  

CREATE 4
ADDID 111
100
0
111
T

54.2

ADDID 551

ADDID 100 
105

T

11.1
5.0


To determine if test 1 passes look for three "Inserted" messages

TEST 2: Print the list and verify three entries are sorted 

PRINT
STATS

To deterine if test 2 passes the list should be printed in order with 3 records.
Also, stats should show 3 records with an array size of 4

TEST 3:  Update the 111 entry in the list and add an ID to fill the table

ADDID 111
106
0
111
F

64.4
2.4
ADDID 333
106
0
333
F
1
3
84.4
2.4

To determine if test 3 passes look for "Updated" and "Inserted" messages

TEST 4: Print the list, verify the entry for id 111 is replaced

PRINT
STATS

To determine if test 4 passes look for 4 records, and the 111 record should be 
updated with Rec# as 4.  Stats should be 4 records, size 4

TEST 5: look for records in the list and not in the list

QUERY 111
QUERY 551 
QUERY 3
QUERY 555

To determine if test 5 passes it should print two records found and
two records not found.  

TEST 6:  Attempt to add fifth record. If list size is 4 then it will replace 551 

ADDID 222
106
1
F
1
3
74.4
2.4

PRINT
STATS

To check test 6, look for Removed if list size is four.  Print shows 4 
records Stats shows 4 records.  If the program is run with a list
size of 5 or larger then the record should be added instead of replaced.

TEST 7: Remove the oldest record number in the list 

TRIM
PRINT

To verify test 7, should see removed 100, and final list
should be printed with 3 records.

TEST 8: Match one record in list.  Verify it is removed

MATCH 2
100
200
222
551
-1
QUERY 222
PRINT

To verify this test, confirm that there was 1 match and record 222 was removed.

TEST 9:  First try to clear when there are no old records.  Then clear all

CLEAROLD 106
PRINT
CLEAROLD 107
PRINT

To verfity check the first clear did not change the list but the second removed all entries.

TEST 10: Quit

To verify, run with valgrind and confirm that both these messages are printed.

All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible

ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)

QUIT

Any lines after the QUIT command are ignored.
